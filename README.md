# HauteLook-Nordstrom-Rack-Code-Night
I was asked to volunteer at Nordstrom Rack HauteLook. And this caused me to sit by myself. I made the best of the situation by coding
some Ruby for a command-line-interface thingy that somehow uses GitHub API to fork and push code on homework assignments.

I hate my life.
